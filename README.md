# MaternaMonitor
The MaternaMonitor is a smartwatch that tracks vitals like heart rate and sends them to our mobile website, which can then be shared with the physician. Our watch incorporates emergency features sleekly integrated with Twilio to notify an emergency contact regardless of whether or not the patient is conscious to activate the sequence. Meaning, pregnant women are able to press emergency buttons to call for help, or if the watch detects a fall, the watch calls for help on behalf of the patient. In MATLAB we performed data analysis of the heart data and calculated the heart rate variability (HRV) and associated statistical analysis of HRV to measure the risk of pregnant patients.
